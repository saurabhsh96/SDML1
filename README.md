# SDML1 (For course SDM)
Matlab routines to find the spectral green's function of various stratified media configurations

There are three different stratified media configurations considered. This project builds and analyzes the 
spectral green's functions of these configurations.

Details of the configurations are mentioned in the file Matlab Instruction 1.
